<p>Thousands of little-known companies have better, cheaper or just plain cooler products than the mass-market choices we usually have.</p>

<p>We help you find them <em>quickly</em>, so you can buy products that fit YOUR individual needs and style (gifts too).</p>

<p>Our large, growing and unbiased list of cool companies also includes profiles, user reviews and comments about the companies.  This helps you quickly find products that you can't find elsewhere without hours of search engine or social media search time.</p>

<p>We focus on companies selling products that are special in some way, such as:</p>

	<table border=2><!-- link these to company examples -->
		<tr>	
			<td>Artisan, Small-Batch or Limited Production</td>
			<td>Innovative Aesthetic and Functional Designs, materials or ingredients</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>	
			<td>Custom Products</td>
			<td>International Finds</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>	
			<td>Environmentally, socially or financially responsible</td>
			<td>Rare, Scarce, One-of-a-Kind</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>	
			<td>Gifts that are Special, Uncommon or Unique</td>
			<td>Special Function/ Purpose Products</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>	
			<td>Hard-to-find or discontinued items</td>
			<td>Uncommon, even unique materials, ingredients, colors, etc.</td>
		</tr>
	</table>


<p>Shopping for products that stand apart like these can be a frustrating process with lots of wasted time.</p>

<p>We looked for a better way, but didn't find one, so we invented it. Your <a href="contact.html">feedback</a> about how to make it better is highly valued.</p>

<p>Here's how it works:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>We continually find new and little-known niche companies from all over the world (over 20,000 and counting)</li>
		<li>Using proprietary databses and algorithms, we analyze each company and select those with products that are truly special in some way</li>
		<li>We then create a brief profile of each company so you can quickly see which ones you want to shop in your search results.</li>
			<ul>
				<li>  This is <em>key</em>.  We don't believe you should have to click on a bunch of links, basically "in the dark", to find out if they're even relevant to what you're looking for</li>
			</ul>
		<li>When you search for something, we find those companies that sell the types of products you're looking for</li>
		<li>Search results include a link to the company and any 3rd party sales sites it uses (if appliable...e.g. Etsy, etc.) and a brief profile of important information about each company.  See the example below</li>
			<img src="images/sample-search.jpg" alt="search sample" title="search sample">
		<li>We encourage you to save your favorite companies to your profile, create shopping lists for gifts, or wishlists for the future, as well as to <a href="contact.html">suggest</a> companies or product types that you would like us to add</li>
		<li>Our search results are unbiased.  We don't accept money from companies to be included in our list, or to get preferential placement in search results</li>
			<ul>
				<li>We make money (it's not much yet, but we have high hopes, if you and others like our site) through advertising, affiliate commissions (at NO additional cost to you) if you click a link to a company and make a purchase (not all companies do this, but we want full disclosure)</li>
			</ul>
		<li>We reguarly explore new content to offer you and new revenue streams (yeah, we have to eat like everyone else:-), BUT our commitment to you is that the companies we select and the companies we suggest based on your searches will be based on your needs and not biased by our financial interests</li>
	</ul>

<p>If you're interested, our <a href="about.html">About</a> page explains the philosophy behind what we do.</p>

<p>In the future we plan to add more value for you like a podcast, specific product recommendations, subscription-based services and content, buyer guides, etc.  In the meantime, please give us a try and <a href="contact.html">let us know</a> what you think and anything you'd like to see on the site.  Thanks!</p>
